#### My Experience:  

I started creating the structure of the app with create-react-app, then use inputs for capture the data that the user will enter, created the structure of the notes, fuctions to delete and edit, the biggest challenge the i have was the localStorage, then i developed a vintage look for the app, take one week of part time work.
